# SpaceX Launch Data Graph Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes SpaceX launch data using graph analysis techniques implemented in Python. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter notebook that leverages ArangoDB for graph database operations.

## Features
- Graph-based analysis of SpaceX launch data
- Integration with ArangoDB for efficient graph operations
- Comprehensive data visualization
- Analysis of launch patterns and relationships

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- python-arango
- Other dependencies as listed in the notebook

## Project Structure
- `spacex_analysis_notebook_v_1_0_0.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook containing:
  1. Data Loading and Graph Creation
  2. Graph Analysis

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bahadirciloglu/colab.git
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install python-arango jupyter
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook spacex_analysis_notebook_v_1_0_0.ipynb
```

## Analysis Components
The notebook performs the following analyses:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Graph construction from SpaceX launch data
- Graph analysis techniques
- Visualization of results
